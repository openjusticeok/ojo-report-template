# OJO HTML Report Format

## How to install / use

When you sit down to start a new report, you can copy the template and all needed files using the following terminal command:

```bash
quarto use template openjusticeok/ojo-report-template
```

This will install the extension and create an example qmd file that you can use as a starting place for your report / article / whatever.
